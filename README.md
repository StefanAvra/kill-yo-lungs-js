# kill-yo-lungs-js
This served as a small prototype while Gurkiman and I were brainstorming for the project that later became the art installation 'MadLove'.
It is written in JavaScript using Phaserjs. I abandoned it very quickly when we decided that we want to make an arcade game in a real cabinet.

## Getting started
If you are curious you can give it a try here: https://stefanavra.github.io/kill-yo-lungs-js/
Note: the code is not waiting for assets to finish loading. If the music is missing reloading the page might help.
